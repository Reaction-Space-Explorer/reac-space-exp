# Imperative Program for Autocatalysis Search

This program search the autocatalysis motif in a network with source-target format. It use the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm applied to find the autocatalytic cycles. This program can create Equilibrator Data in order to include thermodynamic free energy of reaction to the autocatalysis search. Also, some function allow us to draw the autocatalysis cycles and plot hystograms of more connected graph or molecules in the network.
