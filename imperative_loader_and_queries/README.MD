# Imperative Program for Autocatalysis Search

*This program search the autocatalysis motif in a network with source-target format. It use the Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm applied to find the autocatalytic cycles. This program can create Equilibrator Data in order to include thermodynamic free energy of reaction to the autocatalysis search. Also, some function allow us to draw the autocatalysis cycles and plot hystograms of more connected graph or molecules in the network.

* Project status: working

## Installation

Example:

* In order to run this program do you need: Obabel, Skunk, Matplotlib libraries
* In order to instal skunk  use: pip install skunk
